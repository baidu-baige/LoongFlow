# Contributing to LoongFlow

First of all, a huge thank you to the open-source community for your attention and support of the LoongFlow project 🎉. We welcome and encourage contributions from the community. Whether it's fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or sharing ideas, all contributions help make LoongFlow better.

Before getting started, please read the following open-source contribution guidelines and adhere to the relevant agreements.

## How to Contribute

### Contributing Information/Ideas

LoongFlow uses the GitHub Issue system to manage bug reports and feature proposals. You can contribute your information or ideas by creating an Issue.

Before creating a new Issue, please first search through existing Issues to see if a similar or identical one already exists. If your case is similar to an existing Issue, simply add your details by replying to that Issue. If you confirm that no similar Issue exists, then don't hesitate—create a new one.

#### Issue Requirements

- Briefly describe the main problem of the Issue.
- Your system environment information, including but not limited to: LoongFlow version, Python version, OS version, etc.
- Describe what you believe should have happened.
- Describe what you actually observed.
- Provide any other potentially useful clues to help us identify the issue, such as logs, screenshots, minimal reproducible code samples, etc.

### Contributing Code

LoongFlow accepts code contributions through the standard GitHub PR (Pull Request) process. Please first fork the repository, commit your fixes to your forked repository, and then submit a PR to LoongFlow. Code maintainers will conduct a Code Review upon receiving your PR and merge it into the main codebase once confirmed.

Please use the following template when submitting a Pull Request:

- What is the purpose of the code changes in this PR?
- Briefly describe your solution to the issue.

All PRs must correspond to an Issue and include the associated Issue number in the PR description. Your submitted PR must first pass CI pipeline validation to minimize the risk of introducing new issues. It will also need to be reviewed by at least two code maintainers, which may take some time—thank you for your patience.
